I am a final year **Ph.D. candidate in Statistics** at the Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. 

My primary research focuses on **Bayesian nonparametrics**, **machine learning**, and **artificial intelligence**. Particularly, my research deals with **Bayesian nonparametric clustering** and **feature allocation** of complex data in the presence of additional information, with applications spanning **genetics, multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics, health outcomes**, and beyond.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my undergraduate (BSc.) and master's (MSc.) degrees in **statistics**, respectively, from India and thereafter, I worked at **Novartis India Ltd**. as a biostatistician for several years.
