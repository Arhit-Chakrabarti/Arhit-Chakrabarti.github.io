  <p>
    I am a final year <strong>Ph.D. candidate in Statistics</strong> at the Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My primary research focuses on <strong>Bayesian nonparametrics</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. Particularly, my research deals with <strong>Bayesian nonparametric clustering</strong> and <strong>feature allocation</strong> of complex data in the presence of additional information, with applications spanning <strong>genetics, multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics, health outcomes</strong>, and beyond.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my undergraduate (BSc.) and master's (MSc.) degrees in <strong>statistics</strong>, respectively, from India and thereafter, I worked at <strong>Novartis India Ltd.</strong> as a biostatistician for several years.
