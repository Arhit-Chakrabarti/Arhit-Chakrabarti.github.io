I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. 

My primary research focuses on Bayesian nonparametrics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Particularly, my research so far deals with the Bayesian nonparametric clustering and feature allocation of complex data in presence of additional information, with applications spanning genetics, multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics, health outcomes, and beyond.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my undergraduate (BSc.) and master's (MSc.) degrees in statistics, respectively, from India and thereafter, I worked at Novartis India. Ltd. as a biostatistician for several years.
